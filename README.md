# Music Recommender System

## Overview

The Music Recommender System is a project that leverages machine learning and the Spotify API to recommend music to users based on their preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering to find similarities between songs and provides personalized recommendations for users.

## Features

- **Song Recommendations:** Users can input a song, and the system will recommend similar songs based on collaborative filtering.

- **Artist Recommendations:** Users can discover more songs from the same artist through a dedicated artist recommender feature.

- **Interactive Interface:** The project comes with a Streamlit-powered web interface for a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The project is developed using the Python programming language.

- **Streamlit:** The web interface is built using Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the recommendation system.

- **Spotipy:** The Spotify API wrapper Spotipy is used to fetch information about songs and artists.

- **NumPy, Pandas:** These libraries are employed for data manipulation and processing.

- **Scikit-learn:** Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks, including collaborative filtering.

- **Joblib:** Joblib is used for efficient storage and retrieval of precomputed results.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application with `streamlit run app2.py`.
4. Access the web interface in your browser.
